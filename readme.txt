I completed the scrum meeting with Wei Lu(weilu@vt.edu) in person class

From me- I completed API, CODING, BASIC SHELL windows with installation
Only thing that I had to do was to complete the project managment and scrum task
The blocking was the in person meetup with my partner which I overcame during class

From weilu-
His coding, basic shell is done. API and project managment and scrum task was remaining as he was waiting for me to meet
with in person. The things he has to do in futire is complete the scrum and project managment and API related task.
